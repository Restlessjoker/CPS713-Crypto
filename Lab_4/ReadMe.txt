CTRMDES.c  -> contains the source code for the encryption and decryption of the CTRM-DES block cipher.  

CTRMDES -> the binary file, compiled from the source code: CTRMDES.c

CBCMDES.c  -> contains the source code for the encryption and decryption of the CBCM-DES block cipher.  

CBCMDES -> the binary file, compiled from the source code: CBCMDES.c

compile.txt -> instructions to compile and run the source code: CTRMDES.c

results.txt ->  results from several sample inputs presented to the algorithm and the respective outputs generated by the algorithm. This is for both encryption and decryption of several different plaintext and cipher texts.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Our algorithm is efficient in that, it converts the inputed plaintext or cipher text to binary before it computes the XOR between each round key. Instead, of assuming the plaintext will always be in binary form or the user forgets to input a binary plaintext or cipher text, our algorithm will simply convert their string into binary using mod 2 for every character.
